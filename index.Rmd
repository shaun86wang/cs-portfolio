# Introduction
This page serves as a demonstration of projects Shaun accomplished through various classes during his pursuit of a Computer Science degree in Grand Canyon University. The sidebar presents a list of projects for simpler navigation. Different projects may be presented in different formats (websites, PDF, code snippets, etc). Keep in mind that this is not an inclusive list of all the projects throughout the course-walk. 

**Languages used by these projects include: C++, C#, JavaScript, SQL, Python, GLSL, HTML, MIPS Assembly.**

**Concepts included in these projects include: OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, Web Development, Relational Database, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Linear Algebra, Computer Graphics, Mathematical Modeling.**

# Machine Learning Web App
This project is an implementation of various machine learning algorithms and methods through a web app. The app includes demos for **text classification** and **image detection** using **Naive Bayes, KNN, K-means clustering, TFIDF** in **R**.

# WebGL Computer Graphics
This project is a 3D model of one of the GCU apartments. The project implements computer graphics concepts such as **lighting, projection, scaling, texture**, etc. Note that all the components are built from scratch *without* libraries such as three.js. The project is written in **JavaScript, GLSL, and HTML**.

# Data Structure Maze Solving
This project creates a maze based on an input text file. It then attempts to solve the maze depth-first using **stack**, breath-first using **queue**, or shortest-distance-next using **heap** and visualizes it through an interactive web application. This project is written in **C#, JavaScript (React)**.
